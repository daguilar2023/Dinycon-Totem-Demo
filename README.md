# Dinycon-Totem-Demo
Demo of Dinycon Totem project

This Front-end demo is a project I made during my Front-end internship at Dinycon Sistemas.

The Idea behind these totems that I've helped developed is to introduce interactive touch-screen kiosks, commonly found in public spaces like malls, that can be fully customized for different client needs, such as displaying advertisements, offering promotions, or providing interactive services.

I've helped develop different demos for Dinycon and this is one of the examples.
